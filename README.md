# MY-UNIVERSITY-NAME-FOR-JB

A file to sign up for my school name on jet-brain

Well I'm a computer Science student of the University of Abuja in Nigeria porpularly known as UniAbuja.

I just discovered my school isnt registered on GIt-hub cause I was trying to get me a lisence for Jet-Brains so I can compile my Kotlin code.

I am actually new to <git hut> completely and I appologise for any rubish what am doing may sound like.
  
  I discovered that am leaning how to use git-hub, although I have been google searching to find help for some of my coding issue. Am a little bit excited bout the whole thing. 
  I hope i get my lisence thouhg.
  
  Thank you :-)
